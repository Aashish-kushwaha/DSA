what is strassen's method
Q.if list is sorted and you use linear search, what can be the benefit?
->If the list is sorted and you are using linear search, then if the current element is larger 
than the search element (if list is in ascending order), then we can establish that the search 
element is not present.Though this does not improve the time complexity but it improves the 
real time performance greatly.
